# NVDIA-LSTM-Prediction-Model
Multivariate Stacked LSTM neural network to forecast daily returns for high-volatility assets (NVDA), achieving a 1.65% Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on out-of-sample test data.
Utilized a normalized 9-dimensional feature space by fusing the Fama-French 5-Factor Model with alternative sentiment data, as well as ticker volume data, to capture both fundamental valuation and market psychology.Created a Hybrid sentiment signal by aggregating 20,000+ financial headlines from three disparate sources (Market-wide, Ticker-specific, and Macro-Event data) using VADER lexicon analysis. Applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to quantify market sentiment, mapping raw text headlines to normalized compound polarity scores (-1 to +1) for neural network ingestion.Optimized model hyper-parameters using Early Stopping and Time-Series Cross-Validation, preventing overfitting on noise while maintaining sensitivity to recent market regime shifts (2025–2026)
